# Real-Racing-3-Keroxea-Edition
A serverless version of Real Racing 3 developed by Keroxea.

This is the old version of Real Racing 3. Some versions may not work on current Android versions. You can launch the game using a virtual master.

The game file may not be compatible with all devices. If the game crashes, set the date to November 13th, and if that doesn't work, try January 3rd.

I wish you good games and competitive races, racers!
